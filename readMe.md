This application is being used for the storage of names and addresses via the local storage of data. Users can input new addresses, make adjustments to previously entered addresses, and search a table of stored addresses. This application was developed and made with the intention of assisting users with stored addresses while using their internet browser. This answers the issue, we feel, of having to remember addresses, or send text messages asking for it, when you previously had it told to you. This applcation was developed using Javascript, CSS, and HTML. This application also used the BULMA framework for the CSS style pages.
